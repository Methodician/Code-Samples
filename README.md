# Code-Samples

This project was created purely to display snippets and code samples to impress prospective collaborators, partners, or employers.

## TypeScript

I'm a huge fan of TypeScript. Not every JS developer likes TS. Many argue that
it "doesn't help reduce bug density" as much as others claim, which I think is
beside the point. TS reduces cognitive load, adds an intrinsic layer of documentation, and best of all makes your intellisense buttery-smooth and allows for access to said intrinsic documentation as you type without looking elsewhere.

## JavaScript

JS is great. It has come so far over the past few years while libraries, frameworks, and code editors have built on that foundation to create a world-class programming experience. Still, I often find myself trying to replicate some of the structure and clarity of TypeScript in my JS projects. Most recently I've come to really appreciate JSDocs and their still-in-progress support in VSCode

## Angular

I first transitioned from full-stack with a back-end focus to more front-end and serverless after falling in love with Angular and TypeScript. I still feel like Angular provides the most comprehensive, smooth, and capable experience for most projects beyond hello-world. But, as I've grown and developed my skills I've come to appreciate other tools almost as much

## React

More recently I've had a lot of exposure to React, leading teams to success and learning many awesome things. It's kind of nice to have the freedom and flexibility to roll whatever routing tools you want, to work in a JS-first world, etc... but I find that 90% or so of the time we all use the same exact tools in React. I'm still in love with Angular and TypeScript, but React is a close second. I'm really inspired to dive into other front-end libraries and frameworks, and I find that my TS and Angular work has become even better and more refined since I've been forced to fend for myself in the wild west of React and JS.
