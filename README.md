## TypeScript

I'm a huge fan of TypeScript. Not every JS developer likes TS. Many argue that
it "doesn't help reduce bug density" as much as others claim, which I think is
beside the point. TS reduces cognitive load, adds an intrinsic layer of documentation, and best of all makes your intellisense buttery-smooth and allows for access to said intrinsic documentation as you type without looking elsewhere.
